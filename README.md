## How It Works

The bot operates through a carefully designed workflow that ensures reliability and user satisfaction:

1. **URL Reception**: When a user sends a message, the bot first validates it as a properly formatted URL
2. **YouTube Validation**: The bot checks if the URL points to YouTube, ensuring it can process the request
3. **Progress Notification**: A "processing" message keeps the user informed that their request is being handled
4. **Audio Extraction**: Using pytube, the bot downloads the highest quality audio stream available
5. **File Processing**: Filenames are sanitized to remove problematic characters, and file size is checked against Telegram's limits
6. **Delivery**: The audio file is sent to the user with a success message
7. **Cleanup**: Temporary files are automatically deleted to prevent disk space issues

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability. The tests cover filename sanitization, message handlers, error handling, and more. Running tests helps catch bugs before they affect users.

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run all tests
pytest tests.py -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests.py --cov=bot --cov-report=html
```

### Automated Testing

The repository includes GitHub Actions configuration that automatically runs tests when you push changes or create pull requests. This continuous integration setup tests the bot across multiple Python versions (3.7 through 3.11) to ensure broad compatibility.

## Docker Deployment

Docker simplifies deployment by packaging the bot with all its dependencies. The included Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml provide a complete containerized solution with health checks, resource limits, and automatic restart capabilities.

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t youtube-audio-bot .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here youtube-audio-bot
```

### Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose provides additional benefits like easy environment variable management and service orchestration:

```bash
# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f telegram-bot

# Restart the service
docker-compose restart

# Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down
```

## Configuration Options

The bot supports several configuration options through environment variables, allowing you to customize its behavior without modifying code:

| Variable             | Description                                     | Default | Required |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your bot token from BotFather                   | None    | Yes      |
| `LOG_LEVEL`          | Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) | INFO    | No       |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`   | Maximum file size in megabytes                  | 50      | No       |

## Error Handling

The bot includes sophisticated error handling to provide a smooth user experience even when things go wrong:

- **Invalid URLs**: Provides clear feedback about proper URL format with examples
- **Non-YouTube URLs**: Specifically requests YouTube links to set proper expectations
- **Connection errors**: Handles network issues gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **Large files**: Proactively notifies users when files exceed Telegram's 50MB limit
- **Download failures**: Manages restricted or unavailable videos with helpful error messages
- **Cleanup on errors**: Ensures temporary files are removed even if processing fails

## Security Considerations

This project implements several security best practices to protect both the bot and its users:

- **Token Security**: Bot tokens are stored in environment variables, never committed to version control
- **Input Validation**: All URLs are thoroughly validated before processing
- **File System Safety**: Filenames are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Resource Limits**: File size limits and timeouts prevent abuse
- **Error Information**: Error messages are designed to be helpful without exposing sensitive system information
- **Container Security**: Docker setup runs as non-root user for additional isolation

For production deployments, consider the additional security measures outlined in [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Bot not responding:**
First, verify your bot token is correctly set in the `.env` file. Then check that the bot is actually running by looking for log output. Finally, ensure you're messaging the correct bot in Telegram.

**Module import errors:**
Make sure your virtual environment is activated before installing dependencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to ensure all packages are installed. Verify you're using Python 3.7 or higher with `python --version`.

**YouTube download failures:**
YouTube frequently updates their platform, which can break download functionality. Update pytube to the latest version with `pip install --upgrade pytube`. Also check if the video is public and available in your region, as some videos have geographic or age restrictions.

**Docker issues:**
If the Docker container exits immediately, check the logs with `docker-compose logs`. Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid bot token. Verify Docker has enough resources allocated, especially if running on Docker Desktop.

For more detailed troubleshooting information, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Viewing Logs

Logs are essential for understanding what your bot is doing and diagnosing issues:

```bash
# For direct Python execution
python bot.py  # Logs appear in console

# For Docker deployment
docker-compose logs -f telegram-bot

# To save logs to a file
python bot.py > bot.log 2>&1
```

### Health Monitoring

The Docker setup includes health checks that automatically restart the bot if it becomes unresponsive. For additional monitoring, consider implementing a status command or integrating with monitoring services.

### Regular Maintenance

To keep your bot running smoothly:

- Update dependencies regularly, especially pytube: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
- Monitor disk usage in the `audios/` directory
- Review logs for recurring errors or unusual patterns
- Keep your bot token secure and rotate it periodically

## Limitations

While powerful, the bot has some inherent limitations to be aware of:

- **File Size**: Maximum 50MB due to Telegram Bot API restrictions
- **Processing Time**: Larger videos take longer to download and convert
- **Availability**: Some videos may be geo-restricted, age-gated, or private
- **Format**: Currently outputs in the original audio format (usually .mp4 audio container)
- **Concurrent Users**: Default setup handles one request at a time
